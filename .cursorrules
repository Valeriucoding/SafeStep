  - name: "Mobile-First Development"
    description: |
      - All UI components and layouts must be designed and built for mobile devices first
      - Use mobile breakpoint (max-width: 640px or 375px–428px viewport) as the default
      - Desktop and tablet layouts should be progressive enhancements using min-width media queries
      - Touch targets must be minimum 44x44px for accessibility
      - Test all interactions assuming touch input (no hover states as primary interaction)
      - Optimize images and assets for mobile bandwidth and performance
      - Use responsive units (rem, em, %, vw/vh) instead of fixed pixels where appropriate
      - Consider mobile-specific patterns: bottom navigation, hamburger menus, swipe gestures
      - Ensure text is readable without zooming (minimum 16px base font size)
      - Stack elements vertically by default, using flexbox/grid for mobile layouts
